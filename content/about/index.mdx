Born in Flushing, NY but raised in Pereira, Colombia. I moved back to the United States at 17 to pursue a career as a software developer and have worked in customer service and IT. I've since gained excellent communiaction skills and have learned the value of putting the customer's needs above all, as well as the ability to break down complex instructions into easy to follow guidance. I am not afraid to self-educate when faced with a challenge, but I know the importance of reaching out when neccessary. 

I'm working on my CompTIA Project+ certification and have experience with:

* Windows, macOS, Linux
* Android, iOS
* Hardware & software installation
* LAN / WLAN, network hardware installation, network troubleshooting & maintenance
* VPN, remote access software, imaging software
* POS, inventory, documentation
* Microsoft Office 365, G Suite
* Some C++, Java, Python, SQL
