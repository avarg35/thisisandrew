### Hi! I'm Andrew Vargas.

I'm a student at Western Governors University majoring in **computer science**. I've been tinkering with electronics since I was 9, and have recently started learning to code. I'm looking to expand my knowledge while gaining experience through any opportunities that are thrown my way!
