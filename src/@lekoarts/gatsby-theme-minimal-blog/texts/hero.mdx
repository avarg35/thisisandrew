### Hi! I'm Andrew Vargas.

I'm a student at **Western Governors University** majoring in **computer science**, but have had an interest in coding my whole life. I am expecting to graduate in June 2022 and am currently looking to expand my knowledge and experience through any opportunities that are thrown my way!
